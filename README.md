FAQ
----------------------------

_What is a code review?_

A code review is when a group of people get together and talk about a
part of one person's code. This code can either be something really
cool you discovered and would like to share, something you would like
feedback on (optimization, stuck on a problem, â€¦), or simply
something representative of your work. It is a common practice in
software development and has been found to be the most effective way
to find bugs in code. Here is an interesting piece on introducing code
review to scientists: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.5648v2.pdf [1]

_Why are you founding this group?_

I have found code reviews to be a great place to learn. When I present
my code it is useful to hear comments and feedback and gain a
different perspective on my work. When other people present I learn
new techniques, am introduced to new packages, and pick up tricks I
never would have otherwise seen.

_Who should attend?_

All levels are welcome and encouraged to attend - I believe it will be
most successful with a full spectrum of coding levels (from thinking
about coding to expert). To begin I would like to stick with Python as
language. However, once we have established the group we can discuss
expanding to other languages and people. Feel free to invite
undergrads and research staff, too!

_When?_

We will be meeting bi-weekly, starting October 25, 2017 in 2.28.2.080 (Campus Golm)

_How?_

In the beginning of our meetings in October I will provide an introduction to git and
github to anyone who does not feel comfortable using the tool. Every
other week a different person will volunteer to present their code to
the group. The code presented should be fairly self-contained and not
more than a page. It should also include some comments for the ease of
use of the group. Code should be available at least 24 hours prior to
the meeting. If you have time, you can comment on the code directly on
github. In our meeting, the person presenting the code will give a
little background on why they are writing the code and then walk the
group through it. We will then discuss it.


Code of Conduct
-----------------

Code Review is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. However, we recognise that some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. **We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.**
Harassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above
causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
- publication of private communication without consent

Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All Code Review interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

**Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.**

_Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all._
